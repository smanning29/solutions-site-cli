            "Globally, one third of all food does not make it from the farms and factories, where it is either grown or produced, to our plates. The process of making food that ever gets eaten wastes a LOT of valuable resources. For example, seeds, water, energy, land, fertilizer, people’s time working, and money is wasted. Wasted food makes up 8 percent of global <span class='font-bold text-forest'>greenhouse gas emissions</span> every year!",
            `Climate change solutions are often located at the connection between people and the environment. Two examples of the important connections between people and the environment are <span class="bg-sun25">high-quality reproductive healthcare</span> and <span class="bg-sun25">equal educational opportunities</span>. Both of these issues are human rights and they are both very important to ensure that women and men are treated equally. When everyone has access to reproductive healthcare and equal educational opportunities, we are better prepared to address climate change.`,
            `Focusing on eating fruits and vegetables as our main source of food can help keep us healthy and help prevent climate change. In many countries, including the United States, most people eat meat as their main course every meal and include fruits and vegetables as side courses. Eating meat as the main food source is becoming more common around the world. 
                However, eating so much meat contributes a lot to global warming. Meat production accounts for 20 percent of global <span class='font-bold text-forest'>greenhouse gas emissions</span>. If all the cattle in the world lived together in their own country without humans, that country would place third for the largest producer of greenhouse gas in the world.`,
            `Refrigerators keep our food cold to make sure it stays fresh. Air conditioners keep buildings and homes cool during hot summers. Both refrigerators and air conditioners use chemicals that can absorb and give off heat to create cool air. These chemicals are called <span class="bg-sun25">refrigerants</span>. Up until 1987, two of the most common types of refrigerants were chlorofluorocarbons <span class="bg-sun25">(CFCs)</span> and hydro-chlorofluorocarbons <span class="bg-sun25">(HCFCs)</span>. Even though they are effective refrigerants, these chemicals cause a problem.`,
            `Tropical forests, like the Amazon rainforest and the Congo rainforest, used to cover 12 percent of land in the world. In the last few decades, they have been cut down for lumber for buildings, burnt down to make space for farming and ranching, and cleared so that cities can expand. This destruction not only hurts the trees. It also hurts the animals and other plants that live under and in the trees. Now tropical forests only cover 5 percent of land on Earth. 
                While tropical forest destruction continues in many places, there are also places where new tropical forests are growing. This happens naturally and when people plant trees. This is called <span class="bg-sun25">restoration</span>. New tropical forests capture a lot of <span class='font-bold text-forest'>carbon dioxide</span>, up to six gigatons per year!`,
           //6-10
           `Wind energy is one of the most exciting solutions to <span class='font-bold text-forest'>climate change</span>. Companies are building more <span class="bg-sun25">wind turbines</span> every year. Wind turbines are large wheels that rotate when the wind blows through them. As they rotate, wind turbines convert wind energy into electrical energy that people use in their homes and businesses. Today, there are 314,000 wind turbines around the world! They produce four percent of all electricity used.`,

            "The sun provides an unlimited source of energy, called solar energy. The awesome thing about solar energy is that it has a low impact on our environment! We use solar panels in order to collect the energy from the sun and convert it into electrical energy so we can power the lights, heat, and appliances in our homes and buildings. Have you seen solar panels on top of houses or buildings in your community? Maybe you’ve even seen a huge solar farm like the one in the picture below. These large farms are an example of utility-scale photovoltaics.",
            "Around the world people cook in many different ways. In the United States, you may be used to seeing your family cook dinners on a gas or electric stove or in the microwave. However, about 3 billion people in the world cook their meals on open fires or on very basic stoves.",
            `In the 1800s, solar panels used to be made of selenium. This is a chemical that can spread heat when the sun shines on it. Today, we use something called <span class="bg-sun25">PV (photovoltaic) panels</span>. The PV (photovoltaic) panels are made of tiny silicon crystals. When the sun shines on the crystals, the heat absorbed creates an electric charge. This process doesn’t require any fuel, just sunlight and PV panels. Making energy with solar PV panels doesn’t release any <span class='font-bold text-forest'>greenhouse gases</span>.`,

            `In most modern farms, animals are kept on pastures, fields of grass, without trees. <span class="bg-sun25">Silvopasture</span> is an old and environmentally friendly way to raise cows and other farm animals that includes trees planted in pastures!`,
            `<span class="bg-sun25">Peatlands</span> are one of the most important types of wetlands in the world. They are also sometimes called <span class="bg-sun25">bogs</span> or <span class="bg-sun25">mires</span>.  Peat is made out of dead or <span class="bg-sun25">decomposing</span> plants from hundreds and thousands of years ago. It is formed when dead plants that grew in the peatland areas begin to decompose under a layer of living vegetation and water. The decomposition process never finishes because the water stops the decomposition. Over the years, peat becomes thick and forms a very wet and dense soil. Water-loving plants grow on top of it.`,
            `<span class="bg-sun25">Afforestation</span> is the process of planting trees to create forests in places where there were not forests before. Land that has been used in the past for farming, animal grazing, and even mining can be great places for new trees and <span class="bg-sun25">perennial plants</span> to grow.`,
            `Temperate zones are places on Earth that are located about midway between the equator and the North and South Poles. About 25% of all trees on Earth are found in temperate zones, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. Some of those trees are deciduous, which grow and lose their leaves every year. Other trees are evergreen, with needles that stay green all year round. Throughout human history, 99 percent of temperate forests have been used or changed by humans in some way. Many forests have been used to create wood for construction, while others have been cut down to create space for farming and cities. 
                Even though temperate forests have faced many challenges and pressures, they are very strong. They are able to recover from impacts over time, and can eventually regenerate ecosystems that used to exist many years ago.`,
            "Concentrated solar power (CSP) has been around since the 1980s. It is becoming more and more popular.",
            //16-20
            "It can be really uncomfortable when you feel too warm, or too cold. This is why it’s nice to have heating and cooling systems in offices, restaurants, schools, and homes. But, about 25 to 60 percent of energy that is used for heating and cooling buildings is lost.",
            `Some animals, like bison and antelope, live in grassy places and eat many kinds of small plants. These <span class="bg-sun25">grazing animals</span> are extremely important to the environment. The way they eat and live helps create amazing places like the Serengeti plains in Africa and the tall grass prairies of the United States.`,
            `LED lights are light bulbs that are more environmentally friendly than conventional light bulbs (like incandescent or fluorescent light bulbs). Their name stands for ‘light emitting diodes’ (LED). <span class="bg-sun25">Diodes</span> are small electronic devices that conduct current in one direction. Sometimes they light up. 
                Diodes were invented way back in 1874, but we couldn’t see the light that they were making very well. In 1994, more than 100 years later, Japanese scientists invented LED lights that were just as bright as conventional light bulbs. These scientists won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004 for their work with LEDs.`,
            `The majority of crops we use for food, like corn, are <span class="bg-sun25">annual plants</span>. That means that every year we have to plant new seeds for the crops to grow. Other plants, like trees, are known as <span class="bg-sun25">perennials</span>. People do not need to replant them each year. Every year they continue to grow and get bigger. 
                Perennial crops we grow for food include coconuts, bananas, avocados, and many kinds of nuts. The trees that produce these foods also pull much more carbon out of the air and store more in the soil compared to annual plants.`,
            `<span class="bg-sun25">Tree intercropping</span> means planting trees in fields with  <span class="bg-sun25">crops</span>. This helps the soil hold more carbon and keep carbon dioxide out of the air where it can warm the Earth and cause <span class='font-bold text-forest'>climate change</span>. It also helps crops grow by keeping the soil healthy. The way that farmers plant trees with crops changes based on the type of land, the climate, how much money farmers make on the crop, and the people planting the crop.`

            "The process of moving food from where it is grown or made to where people buy it from grocery stores, is called a supply chain. In some places, food is usually wasted early in the supply chain process. For example, food rots on farms, or goes bad when it is stored or shipped to markets. In other places, food is wasted towards the end of the supply chain. For example, restaurants and customers shopping at grocery stores usually do not buy fruits and vegetables with bumps, bruises or strang coloring. Also, sometimes people buy too much food. The extra food goes bad and gets wasted.",
            "Today there are over 7.7 billion people living on Earth. That includes you! When we think about the future of people on our planet, the number of people who eat, go to school, drive cars, go to work, plug things in, buy things, and throw things away everyday matters. When more people live on our planet, we collectively use more resources. This is because when the population grows, factories need to produce more of the things we need and want. Things we need include beds, silverware, and clothing. Things we want maybe include toys, bikes, and videogames. When the population goes up, so does our global fossil fuel use.",
            `If people eat more fruits, vegetables, and beans, they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Many people think of vegetarian and vegan diets when they think of eating less meat, but those are not the only options. A plant-rich diet can look similar to a vegetarian diet, but also include meat that produces less greenhouse gas emissions, like chicken or fish. The main goal for any plant-rich diet is to center meals around plants instead of meat. Anyone can start eating more plants to lower their emissions.`,
           `If CFCs and HCFCs escape into the air, they can harm part of our atmosphere called the <span class="bg-sun25">ozone layer</span>. In 1987 many people came together to create a new international law called the <span class="bg-sun25">Montreal Protocol</span>. This law said that CFCs and HCFCs can no longer be used as refrigerants. 
                <br><br>When these chemicals were banned, scientists developed a new refrigerant called <span class="bg-sun25">hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</span>.

Solar farms are located on large pieces of land where many, sometimes millions, of <span class="bg-sun25">photovoltaic (PV)</span> panels, all work together. Another more common name for photovoltaic panels is solar panels. Solar farms act as power plants because they produce just as much electricity as power plants that use fossil fuels. Solar farms send energy out to homes, schools, offices, and stores like other power plants. 
                <br><br>What’s the difference between power plants that use fossil fuels and solar farms? The difference is that solar farms don’t release <span class='font-bold text-forest'>greenhouse gas emissions</span> like fossil fuel powered power plants!

This is called “utility-scale” solar. These provide energy for many homes and businesses. </li><li>Individual people install a few PV panels on rooftops or near homes and businesses. This is called “distributed” solar energy collection. This type of PV panel provides energy for the building they are attached to.</li></0l>
                In 2015, distributed solar made up 30 percent of all solar energy produced from PV panels. Germany is the leader in solar energy and has over 1.5 million distributed solar panels. In Bangladesh, a country next to India that has a population of over 157 million people, there are more than 3.6 million solar panels installed on or near homes.`,

            `Trees act as sponges that absorb carbon dioxide.  This process helps reduce the amount of <span class='font-bold text-forest'>greenhouse gasses</span> in the atmosphere. Silvopasture allows the soil to absorb (take in) 5 to 10 times more carbon than pastures that have no trees. The carbon is sequestered, stored, in the trees and dirt. Ultimately, silvopasture also helps to keep the Earth cooler!`,
            `Peat is extremely important to our Earth and the many systems that regulate our planet. While only three percent of the Earth is covered in peat, only the earth’s oceans hold more carbon dioxide. Peatlands store twice as much carbon dioxide as all of the forests in the world combined! Protecting peatlands from fire and development is a very important way to trap <span class='font-bold text-forest'>greenhouse gases</span>.`,
            `Afforestation can happen in a few different ways. One way is to plant many different types of trees and perennials that are <span class="bg-sun25">indigenous</span> to the area, meaning they grow naturally in that specific area. Another way is to plant just one kind of tree that grows very fast. In this method trees are planted as if they are a crop, like the way corn is planted and grown. This method makes up the majority of afforestation efforts and the most commonly tree planted is the Monterey pine. The Monterey pine is actually the most planted tree in the entire world! 
                <br><br>However people plant trees, afforestation creates a carbon sink. A carbon sink is when plants, like trees, absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and hold it in their roots and soil.`,
            `Across the world, there are 1.9 billion acres of temperate forests! These forests act as carbon sinks. The World Resources Institute calculated that another 1.4 billion acres of temperate forests could be grown through <span class="bg-sun25">restoration</span> projects. More trees means more carbon could be captured from the atmosphere and this would help reduce the impact of <span class='font-bold text-forest'>climate change</span>.`,
            `CSP power plants use mirrors to concentrate, or focus, solar rays. These concentrated solar rays heat a fluid, produce steam, and turn <span class="bg-sun25">turbines</span> to create electricity. Concentrated solar power plants need a huge amount of sunlight to create energy so they work best in really sunny and dry places, like deserts.`,

            `Energy that we use to heat and cool rooms and buildings gets wasted because many buildings are not well <span class="bg-sun25">insulated</span>. The heated air, or cooled air, can find its way out of a building through many different ways, such as through cracks around windows and doors. Some materials are better than others for keeping a building well insulated. Buildings that are made out of materials that poorly insulate, such as metal or plastic, basically allow the warm or cold air to leak out. This is how energy is lost due to poor insulation. When builders better insulate a building, the temperature inside stays more constant. We also save energy, and <span class='font-bold text-forest'>greenhouse gas emissions</span> will not be as high!`,
            `Grassy <span class="bg-sun25">ecosystems</span> around the world <span class="bg-sun25">sequester</span> (trap and hide) a lot of carbon dioxide in their soil in the form of biomass. The health of the environment in grassy ecosystems is improved by wild grazing animals. These are herd animals, meaning they stand very close to one another to make sure no one gets hurt or lost. As they walk, they eat the tops of the grass. This way of eating actually helps the grass grow. As they move around the grassy ecosystem, wild grazing animals’ hooves also dig up the dirt a little bit and mix in their poop and pee. This mixing helps fertilize the soil! As a result, more grass grows and the extra grass traps atmospheric carbon in the soil - combatting one of the key components of <span class='font-bold text-forest'>climate change</span>.`,

            `Many perennial crops have been grown and harvested for centuries, and some are very important to the world’s food supply.

           `Carbon is found in all living things. Usually, 50 percent of peatlands are composed of carbon. If they are disrupted by fire or burned to clear space, peat bogs release the carbon they have stored. This means they will let out A LOT of carbon dioxide.  It only takes a few years to release the carbon from peat, but it takes thousands of years for carbon to turn into peat. This is why it is so important to protect peatlands. 
           <br><br>Luckily, 85 percent of the world’s peatlands are healthy! Restoring the 15 percent of peatlands that have been damaged or drained is one way to combat <span class='font-bold text-forest'>climate change</span>.`,
           `When many trees of the same kind are planted close together, we call the land where they grow a <span class="bg-sun25">tree plantation</span>. One reason for planting a tree plantation is to make money from harvesting timber and fibers. Recently it is more popular to plant tree plantations for the purpose of absorbing the carbon dioxide out of our air. 
                The idea of tree plantations is an issue for some people. Why? Because some tree plantation owners do not take care of the land - they only care about making money from the land. This can create long-term issues for the land and the people and environment near the plantations.`,
           `While temperate forests are not as threatened as tropical forests, they are still being cut down to create more room for cities and farming. In addition, <span class='font-bold text-forest'>climate change</span> means that forests will experience hotter and more frequent droughts, longer heat waves, more severe wildfires, and increased insect activity and disease damage. The combination of these impacts can push temperate forests beyond the point they can recover. In order to keep our forests healthy and reduce the impact of climate change, we need to protect the forests we still have and work to restore those that have been damaged.`,
           `Unlike solar panels and wind turbines, CSP creates heat before it makes electricity. The great thing about heat is that it is easier to store than electricity. CSP plants can use the heat created when the sun is shining to warm up tanks full of liquid salt until they are almost boiling! These tanks stay hot for a long time, so CSP plants can continue to make electricity long after the sun goes down each day. 
                <br><br>In 2014, concentrated solar power plants only made 4 gigawatts of electricity, which is not much compared to other solar sources.

For example, the R-value of brick is 0.20 while the R-value of typical asphalt roof shingles is 0.44. Shingles insulate better than bricks. The thermal layer of a building needs to cover ALL the different sides and it must not have any cracks or gaps in the floor, outside walls or the roof.`,
           `Sheep and cows are also grazing animals. But they usually live on farms inside of fenced areas. Sometimes they eat more grass than the land can grow. This isn’t good for the land and means that the soil does not sequester as much carbon. To keep the grass healthy and to keep carbon in the soil, farmers can use managed grazing. <span class="bg-sun25">Managed grazing</span> imitates the way wild grazing animals move around the land. With managed grazing, domestic animals move from field to field so they never eat all the grass in one area.`,
           `LED light bulbs cost two or three times more money than conventional light bulbs. The higher price makes it hard for some people to switch to LEDs in their homes. The good news is that LEDs are becoming less expensive! Also, since LEDs last a lot longer than conventional light bulbs, people will save money in the long term because they do not have to buy light bulbs as often. 
                <br><br> More than a billion people in the world live without electricity. For them, solar LED lights are a great option. These lights don’t need to be plugged into the wall. They only need the sun to power them! Solar powered LED lights can replace expensive oil lamps. They are also a better option than oil lamps because LED lights don’t release unhealthy, toxic fumes.`,
           `Staple crop trees that grow in the tropics, land near the equator, help with issues such as <span class="bg-sun25">erosion</span> and excessive water runoff. Their complex root systems allow for water to get into the soil when it rains. The roots add more water into underground water systems and save water in the soil for dryer times. The tropics are made up of a lot of different landscapes, which sometimes limits where plants can grow. But not tropical staple crops! They can grow on steep slopes of hills and in many different types of soils. Because perennial plants and crops are very strong, humans use less fuel, pesticides and fertilizers to help them grow and produce food.`,

One acre is only a little bit bigger than an American football field. 3 billion football fields is a lot of land and a lot of energy used to grow these annual crops. When land used to grow annual crops is converted to perennial crops, the amount of carbon the land and plants can absorb increases by about two tons per acre! Climate change is a global problem and will change plant-growing conditions around the world. This makes perennial crops even more important.
